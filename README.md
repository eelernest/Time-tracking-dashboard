## My process

First I did an exercise for the layers of the main card with bootstrap.
Then reverse the layers in the following cards, add the colors and adjust the dimensions of the cards.
Finally move to the responsive phase and adjust each element for a correct display.


### Built with

- Html
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-Responsive
- Bootstrap

### What I learned

More than learning, it was to strengthen my knowledge in web development
